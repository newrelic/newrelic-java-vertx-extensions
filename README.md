# New Relic Java Instrumentation for Vertx Extensions

## Installation

To install:
1. In the New Relic Java Agent directory (directory containing newrelic.jar), create a directory named extensions if it does not already exist
2. Download the desired jars from the current release
3. Copy the downloaded jars into the extensions directory
4. Restart the application

## Getting Started

## Building 

If you make changes to the instrumentation code and need to build the instrumentation jars, follow these steps
1. Set environment variable NEW_RELIC_EXTENSIONS_DIR.  Its value should be the directory where you want to build the jars (i.e. the extensions directory of the Java Agent).   
2. Build one or all of the jars.   
  a. To build one jar, run the command:  gradlew _moduleName_:clean  _moduleName_:install    
  b. To build all jars, run the command: gradlew clean install
   
## Testing

Not currently supported.  Will be supported in the future

## Verifying
To verify that the module will load into the Java Agent used the verifyInstrumentation option
see https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-gradle-verify-instrumentation for more information
